# RRoyal brand

## Official logo (final)

**Я x R monogram in Cinzel Medium**, with the ruby location pin at the center of the crossed
scepters and the gold delivery trail underneath. The files at the top of this folder are the
official set:

- `rroyal-logo.svg` / `-1024.png` / `-512.png` / `-256.png`: main logo (256px is the token logo)
- `rroyal-icon.svg` / `-512.png` / `-64.png` / `-32.png`: small-size icon (wallets, favicon)
- `favicon.ico`: multi-size (16/32/48/64/128/256px) icon for browser tabs
- `rroyal-wordmark.svg` / `.png`: wide header version with "RROYAL"
- `logo-preview.png`: everything on dark and light backgrounds

Both the main logo and the icon are centered and scaled so every corner of the
artwork stays inside the circle that Discord, X/Twitter, wallets, and
exchange listings crop square icons to (~83% of the canvas radius). Below
~32px the icon's fine linework gets hard to resolve — that's an inherent
limit of the detail level, not a centering issue.

Regenerate with `node tools/finalLogo.js <out dir>` (see below).

Each folder has an `rrx-font-options.png` comparison sheet plus each option as SVG and PNG.

## Regenerating the logos

The scripts in `tools/` build every option from code (fonts are converted to vector paths).
They need Node.js plus two packages: `npm install --no-save opentype.js@1.3.4 playwright@1.56.1`.

```bash
cd brand/tools
# Mirrored monogram: <out dir> <gap> <variants> [pin-middle]
node logoMirror.js out -0.26 1-cinzel-out,3-cormorant-out pin-middle
node sheet2.js out          # comparison sheet + PNGs
```

The fonts in `tools/fonts*` are from Google Fonts and licensed under the SIL Open Font License.
